# 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis

This project explores the classic **Iris flower dataset** using Python. It includes data loading, exploration, visualization, and basic machine learning techniques for classification.

---

## 📁 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains **150 samples** of iris flowers from three species:  
- *Iris setosa*  
- *Iris versicolor*  
- *Iris virginica*

Each sample includes the following features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Species (target)

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Load and explore the dataset using **pandas**
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Visualize trends and distributions using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Train a basic classification model using **scikit-learn**
- Evaluate model performance

---

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Histogram of features
- Pairplot of feature relationships
- Correlation heatmap
- Boxplots grouped by species
- Confusion matrix for classification results

---

## 🤖 Model Training

A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained to predict the iris species with high accuracy. Feature importance was also visualized to understand which attributes contribute most to prediction.
